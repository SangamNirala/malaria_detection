# Malaria Detection Using Deep Learning

## Overview
This project implements a deep learning model for detecting malaria in blood cell images using TensorFlow. The model leverages various architectures, including CNNs and transfer learning techniques, to classify images as infected or uninfected.

## Features
- Data augmentation and preprocessing techniques to enhance model performance.
- Utilizes TensorFlow Datasets for loading the malaria dataset.
- Implements model training, evaluation, and visualization of results.
- Supports model versioning and logging with Weights & Biases (WandB).

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/malaria-detection.git
   cd malaria-detection
